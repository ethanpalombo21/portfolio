# Reflecting

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project involved working with Airgead Banking to develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time for the purpose of demonstrating to high school students the concepts of fiscal responsibility. The project included two major steps. Step one was to form a flowchart or write pseudocode in order to plan out the coding project. Once the planning was figured out, an object-oriented programming application using C++ code. 

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I set up each separate header and cpp file efficiently while explaining the purpose of each action throughout the code with in-line comments giving reason to each piece of code and why it connects to the other header and cpp files. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The most important step to enhance my code would be increasing the readability as well-written code is easy to read and understand. Being consistent reduces the risk of bugs and thus improves the readability of code. These improvements would make my code more efficient because it would help establish a coding standard that would be easier for me to go back to and search for any issues to fix. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The pieces of code that were the most challenging to write were surprisingly the header files. Although the cpp files were much longer, they were very clear in what they were trying to accomplish while the header files were tough because they need to declare the interfaces to parts of the operating system. If header files weren't used and all the code was crammed into a single cpp file then it would be confusing but header files tie all the information together which made the full program look smooth in the end but was difficult getting used to setting up during the process. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Organization between the headers and cpp files is an underrated skill that will be particularly transferable to work in the future. Not only do proper comments explain to the "company" or professor the purpose of each line of code but it helps in the process of writing code in the first place as each comment reminds the user what the purpose of the previous work they've done is. Especially if the project includes a team of people who may not be working on the project at the same time, organization and fluidity through classes will help productivity by keeping everyone informed. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by including comments describing each function and its purpose across each header and cpp file. each line of code is evenly spaced out and there aren't too many lines crammed into one large paragraph of code. The descriptions for each function are concise yet explain just enough without excluding too much valuable information regarding the purpose and functionality of each line of code.
